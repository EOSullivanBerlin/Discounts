#Teamleader Techtest
This is a React tech test I completed in preparation for starting work with Teamleader. The aim of this test is to create the logic for a number of discounts and display the results using React.

## How discounts work

For now, there are three possible ways of getting a discount:

- A customer who has already bought for over â‚¬ 1000, gets a discount of 10% on the whole order.
- For every product of category "Switches" (id 2), when you buy five, you get a sixth for free.
- If you buy two or more products of category "Tools" (id 1), you get a 20% discount on the cheapest product.

By the way: there may become more ways of granting customers discounts in the future.
