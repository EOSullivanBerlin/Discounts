## Teamleader Techtest
This is a React tech test I completed in preparation for starting work with Teamleader. The aim of this test is to create the logic for a number of discounts and display the results using React.

## How discounts work

For now, there are three possible ways of getting a discount:

- A customer who has already bought for over â‚¬ 1000, gets a discount of 10% on the whole order.
- For every product of category "Switches" (id 2), when you buy five, you get a sixth for free.
- If you buy two or more products of category "Tools" (id 1), you get a 20% discount on the cheapest product.

By the way: there may become more ways of granting customers discounts in the future.

## Setup and tests
Install dependancies

**npm install**

Local Server

**npm start**

Run the test suit

**npm tests**


## Possible areas to improve
### Style
The style could be improved. A bit of basic bootstrap would go along way.

### Functionality
The app just addressed the requirements of displaying the discounts. There is huge room for adding functionality. However, to ensure the most value for the customer as possible for time and money invested I try to deliver the MVP. Elaboration on the core functionallity can then be discussed and the next most important features created.
